# About:

Inspired by GodotManager: https://github.com/eumario/godot-manager

Intended to be lightweight and easy to use but still flexable for more advanced users.

This project has been made from scratch, other than the Godot icons.

Written in GD Script so most Godot users can easily modify or contribute.

The original is written in C# so no code was used in this project.

The original also has not been updated in a while and doesn't seem to work for me in version 4x.

# Progress:

-Project management basics working.

-Support for 4x and 3x projects.

-Create / Import projects.

-Edit / Run Projects.

-Grouping Projects.

-Engine management basics working.

-Download Godot Engine from GitHub.

-Install / Uninstall engine version.

-Open engine specific project manager.

-Multiple settings.

# Plan:

-Add project project templates and more.

-Add ability to choose engine mirror.

-Add asset library management (download, install, upload, etc).

-Add lots of customizable options.

-And more!
