# GodotManagerRedux
A tool to manage all things Godot

Made in Godot 4.3

*Work in progress

# About

Inspired by GodotManager: https://github.com/eumario/godot-manager

This project has been made from scratch other, than the Godot icons.

The original is written in C# so no code was used in this project.

The original also has not been updated in a while and doesn't seem to work for me in version 4x.

# Plan

-Add full project management for multiple Godot versions (old and new).

-Add full engine management (download, update, etc).

-Add asset library management (download, install, upload, etc).

-Add lots of customizable options.
